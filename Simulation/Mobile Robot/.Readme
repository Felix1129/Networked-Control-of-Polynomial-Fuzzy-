With the initial value as the coordinate of the robot and 0.5 as the package dropout rate,
the error comparison is shown. The error of the proposed method is shown in red while the error of the existing method is shown in blue. 
The segment of the Lyapunov function is equal to 2. In the figure, it can be seen that the red line shows a faster response speed at the beginning than the blue line does, 
and the magnitude of oscillation is smaller.Shows the tracking trajectory of the mobile robot in the X-Y plane. The black line represents the desired trajectory, 
the red line represents the proposed method tracking trajectory, and the blue line represents the existing method tracking trajectory.
