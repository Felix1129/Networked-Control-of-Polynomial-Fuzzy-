To proof the negative impact of package dropout on NCSs and package dropout is stochastic, 
setting the package dropout rate in the truetime 2.0 toolbox as and set the disturbance to occur at 20 to 21 seconds, 
with a pulse with an amplitude of 0.8. The time response of the system states and sampled input under package dropout and time delay conditions are shown. 
Since package dropout is a random event, the error time response graphs of x, y, and Î¸ are presented in four simulations. 
The red line is a discrete signal, and the blue line is a continuous signal. 
Based on the following, it is apparent simulation diagram that the proposed new piecewise polynomial fuzzy controller can still correctly track continuous signals when the network causes package dropout,
which verifies that the proposed novel piecewise polynomial fuzzy controller can effectively control the network system while ensuring the stability of the system.
