Assuming the initial condition of the robot is  [0, 0], and the consultation linear velocity and angular velocity are 0.5(m/s).
The external disturbance which is defined as pulse with amplitude 0.8(m/s) and 0.8(rad/sec) and occurred during the 10 sec to the 11 sec. 
The experimental results can be shown.
