#Mobile Robot#
A mobile robot known as the C01 intelligent service robot is depicted.  
Each of the robot's three processors has its own function.
An operating system called Linux is installed on the head. 
Windows 10 is the operating system of the body tablet. 
Lastly, we have the microprocessor that drives the motor.
Processors running Linux systems are mainly responsible for SLAM and navigation missions. 
This body tablet uses the Windows 10 operating system to solve problems concerning voice recognition and image recognition. 
To control the motor, the motor-driven microprocessor receives signals from the Linux system. The chassis is also equipped with sensors such as LIDAR, collision sensors, ultrasound, and infrared.

#Quadrotor#
The quadrotor used in this thesis is a ZD550. 
It is made of carbon fiber and has a diagonal wheelbase of 550. 
The propellers are 14 inches in diameter and 55 inches in pitch. 
Since the composition of the quadrotor is made of carbon fiber, the weight of the whole quadrotor with its battery is only 2kg.
The Pixhawk standard provides a cost-effective way to design autopilot hardware. 
Thus, many UAVs use Pixhawk. Pixhawk has a random access memory (RAM) frequency of 168MHz and flash memory of 2MB. 
The chip of the Pixhawk adopts a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4 Core microcontroller. 
Furthermore, Pixhawk has two sets of gyroscope sensors, a 3-axis accelerometer magnetometer sensor, and an air pressure sensor. 
Two GPS sensors are connected to the host. One GPS sensor is on standby while the other is working. 
It will automatically switch when a failure occurs. 
The error occurs GPS sensor will switch into a standby state, and it will automatically switch when another error occurs.
